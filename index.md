Welcome to my homepage! 

I am an AI scientist whose career goal is to understand computational principles underlying intelligence. More specifically, I study agents that interact with a sequential environment to improve their behavior through trial and error. The best formulation I know of that enables us to study this problem is called reinforcement learning setting. 

I have a PhD and an extensive background in the theoretical and empirical foundations of reinforcement learning. I have published more than a dozen papers at top-tier AI conferences such as Neurips, ICML, AAAI, and ACL. On the more academic side, I have recently spent a lot of effort in understanding optimization in reinforcement learning. On the more industrial side, I am quite interested in the application of AI to agents that interact with humans and learn from their feedback. My aspiration is to make AI agents that co-exist with and help us live our best lives.

The best way to reach me for career-related stuff is by shooting me an email at kavosh@alumni.brown.edu. I am genuinely interested in forming meaningful connections with fellow AI scientists, students, and enthusiasts, so feel free to reach out even if we never met in person.
