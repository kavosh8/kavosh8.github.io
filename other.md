*	I was a professional gamer (the game was called FIFA and is now called EAFC and is made by Electronic Arts), and won various domestic events when I was younger. Unfortunately, my reaction time naturally deteriorated over time and especially when I hit my late 20s, but I still play a lot of FIFA for fun. 
*	I love watching the English Premier League Soccer. It is quite common for me to wake up at 5AM over the weekend to catch top matches of the league.
*	I am also a newbie at the Violin (started 2 years ago without prior musical background), and I hope to transition into a low-key violinist when I retire. My interest in violin was born when I bumped into a group of musicians on streets of Paris who were playing [Brahms' Hungarian dance number 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vqt51VVidY).
